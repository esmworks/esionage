/**
 * Requests from connected apps: MCP clients a user authorized over OAuth (/mcp) and programs with a
 * REST API token (/api/v1). Each workspace's owners decide what those may do there
 * (`connectedApps` in WorkspaceSettings): whatever their user may ("full"), only read ("read"), or
 * nothing, the workspace then being hidden from them ("off").
 *
 * The two endpoints run each request inside `runAsConnectedApp`, and the access checks (access.ts)
 * hold it to the policy the way they hold browser sessions to the sign-in policies: a hidden
 * workspace reads as one the user isn't in, and in a read-only one any access check made while
 * `writing` is refused. Writing is decided by the endpoint (a write tool, an endpoint needing
 * pages:write), not by the check, so writes that only ask for membership (a top-level page, say)
 * are refused as well.
 *
 * Only the user the app acts for is held to it: checks on someone else's behalf in the same request
 * (who gets notified, a form's publisher) are not.
