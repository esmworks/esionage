 * worked out by `page_access_level`, drizzle/*_groups.sql).
 *
 * - Workspace owners create, rename and delete groups and choose who is in them. Owners and members
 *   see the groups and who is in them (like the members list); guests don't.
 * - Only owners and members can be in a group. Someone who becomes a guest leaves their groups
 *   (setMemberRole), and leaving or being removed from the workspace takes them out of its groups
 *   in the same statement (the membership row points at `workspace_member`).
 * - Taking access away (removing someone from a group, deleting a group) hands pages nobody could
 *   manage any more to the owner who did it, as removing someone from the workspace does, and
 *   drops open editors that lost access.
