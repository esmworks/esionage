 * Like the database blocks (lib/embed-blocks), the configs here are shared by the editor (React
 * specs, components/page/content-blocks.tsx) and the server (plain specs, server/blocknote.ts).
 * Both schemas must know every block: y-prosemirror and the server editor drop nodes they don't
 * know, and a block one side drops is lost for everyone.
 *
 * Sources are kept as the block's text, not as props: an equation or a diagram is edited in the
 * document like a code block, so collaborators' keystrokes merge and search finds the source.
