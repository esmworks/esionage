 * Instance administrators: whoever runs the server names them in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated,

 * restart, like any other server setting.
 *
 * Only a verified address counts. Email and password sign-up never verifies one, so anyone could
 * register an account with the admin's address before its owner does; it becomes an admin only
 * once the address is proven (a reset link that reached it, a provider or single sign-on that
 * vouches for it, a confirmed email change, or `pnpm auth:verify-email` on the server).
