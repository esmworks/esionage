/**
 * End-to-end check of a teamspace's member level ("what members get on its pages") against the
 * database: at the default (full access) nothing changes; lowered to "can edit", a plain member
 * gets edit where a page says nothing, while the teamspace's owners and the workspace's owners keep
 * full access and a page's own entry for everyone still decides; members who haven't joined an
 * open teamspace never get more than its members; whoever adds or moves a page to its top keeps
 * full access; property access rules now hold for the members; the Share panel and the property
 * access dialog say so; only workspace owners change it in a default teamspace; a private
 * teamspace stays out of a workspace owner's reach; MCP shows it; the change is in the audit log.
 * Creates its own users and workspace and deletes them afterwards.
 *
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/teamspace-member-access-e2e.ts
 *
 * Env: DATABASE_URL (read from .env when present). Migrations must be applied.
